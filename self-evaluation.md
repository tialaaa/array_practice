How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel confident with what we've learned about Arrays so far. I still sometimes count out each element to get the correct Index position, to account for first element = index 0.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Nope, moving full speed ahead to make up time.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
- Related to array methods... When I tried to combine the two code lines below into one code line, it returned the number of elements [5] instead of listing all 5 strings like I expected. But it worked as expected with the slice method. Why was that? It it possible to condense the array method & console log into one line for methods other than slice?

```javascript
soupVegetables.push("beans")
console.log(soupVegetables)
// Returns: [ 'carrots', 'celery', 'onion', 'peas', 'beans' ]

console.log(soupVegetables.push("beans"))
// Returns: 5

console.log(milesDriven.slice(1));
// Returns: [ false, false, true, true ]
```
